I've spent enough time lurking in forums, reading other people's writeups, and mentally drafting responses I never posted. Figured it was time to actually contribute something.

This blog isn't going to be a tutorial factory or a news aggregator. There are plenty of those already.

I'll write about things I'm exploring, or that caught my attention, and occasionally rant about security drama. No fixed schedule, no filler content. Just whatever's worth sharing when it's worth sharing.

If you're here, you probably care more about depth than frequency. We'll get along fine.

See you soon, FR13ND.
