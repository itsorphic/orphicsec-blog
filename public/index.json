[{"content":"After having a conversation with some coworkers recently, I’ve realized that I subconsciously do a lot to maximize my efficiency when trying to focus on a task. I decided to take inventory of all the strategies that have stuck with me over the years in an effort to distill them down into a few simple tips that I (and hopefully you) can remember for the next time you need to focus on something.\nThink of these tips as tools in your toolkit, not a single tool that should be applied to everything. I encourage you to pick and choose which tools work for you and your situation. I think it is important to make this distinction because I do not want to give the impression that all of these tips can or should be applied to every situation. They are, instead, simply ideas I’ve found useful for problems I’ve encountered. Additionally, please use them responsibly as it is all too easy to burn out. Focusing intensely on something can, and I would argue should be fun, however, it is very easy to get caught up in the cycle of trying to achieve maximum efficiency.\nThe tips and strategies I have laid out in this post are not meant to be employed for 40 hours a week. If I’m employing them correctly, there is no way I would be able to use these tips for every task I need to focus on, but that is kind of the point. I don’t want to focus that intensely for 40 hours a week. I want to focus intensely for a few hours a week so my work doesn’t take me the whole 40 hours.\nOften times I know I should sit down and simply focus on a single task, so why is this so difficult to achieve in practice? Enter: The whirlwind. The whirlwind, which I learned about by reading The 4 Disciplines of Execution, is the idea that a describes the “massive amount of energy that’s necessary just to keep your operation going on a day-to-day basis”. For the purposes of focus, I think of the whirlwind as “The massive amount of energy that’s necessary just to be focus on a single task”. The whirlwind is not just digital noise such as notifications, it is also the physical distractions that come from your surroundings, and metal noise that manifests itself as an urge to check twitter, discord, or work on some other less boring project. Here are some tips for managing to get focused work done in spite of the whirlwind.\nManaging Digital Noise Decrease the size of your digital buffer, don’t have anything open that is not needed. Turn off all notifications and close everything that can pop up and distract you. Block distractions. I do this by blocking things at a DNS level using PiHole. Sure, it’s simple to undo but it creates friction. Managint Physical Noise Noise canceling headphones are amazing. I use These Bose Headphones. A luxury for sure, but one worth investing in. Remove anything that can ding, beep, buzz, or sneeze. Phones, cats, siblings, roommates, etc. Put them or yourself in another room. I find that when I’m watching lectures or videos I like to do something with my hands. Flipping a pen/coin helps.
